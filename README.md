# Transpareat

A platform that enables end-to-end traceability of food products, from farm to table, improving transparency and accountability in the food supply
chain.

## Motivation

The lack of transparency in the food supply chain poses a significant threat to public health, with nearly one in ten people falling ill annually due to contaminated food, resulting in approximately 420,000 deaths. The absence of accessible information about the farm, production processes, and the individuals responsible for food production contributes to these health risks. In instances of contamination or quality issues, the inability to trace the source impedes accountability and erodes trust in the food industry. Transpareat aims to address this critical issue by providing users with comprehensive details about their food, enabling them to make informed choices, and fostering accountability throughout the entire food supply chain.
